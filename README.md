  While the classical builder pattern in Java is proven to simplify object
  instantiation it is known to have some inherent imperfections that leave room
  for improper use and open for run-time failures. In this paper we improve the
  classical pattern. As the main contribution we formalize the two main
  problems we see in the approach today and refine the pattern such that we
  overcome these limitations at a cost of some auxiliary plain Java code. We
  validate our result empirically.  We run the refined pattern through two
  major contemporary Java development environments -- Eclipse and IntelliJ --
  and report how the improved source code comprehension opens for better
  developer guiding, higher developer productivity and higher code quality.
